							<h2>Workshop on Recommender Systems in Fashion</h2>
							<p>Worldwide (online), 26th September 2020</p>
						
								<p>Online Fashion retailers have significantly increased in popularity over the last decade, making it possible for customers to explore hundreds of thousands of products without the need to visit multiple stores or stand in long queues for checkout. However, the customers still face several hurdles with current online shopping solutions.  For example, customers often feel overwhelmed with the large selection of the assortment and brands. In addition, there is still a lack of effective suggestions capable of satisfying customers’ style preferences, or size and fit needs, necessary to enable them in their decision-making process. Moreover, in recent years social shopping in fashion has surfaced, thanks to platforms such as Instagram, providing a very interesting opportunity that allows to explore fashion in radically new ways. Such recent developments provides exciting challenges for Recommender Systems and Machine Learning research communities.
								</p>

							<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in the fashion, recommendations and machine learning domains to discuss open problems in the aforementioned areas. This involves addressing interdisciplinary problems with all of the challenges it entails. Within this workshop we aim to start the conversation among professionals in the fashion and e-commerce industries and recommender systems scientists, and create a new space for collaboration between these communities necessary for tackling these deep problems. To provide rich opportunities to share opinions and experience in such an emerging field, we will accept paper submissions on established and novel ideas, as well as new interactive participation formats.</p>

All submissions present work evaluated in at least one of the described open datasets will be considered for the best paper, best student paper and best demo awards, which will be given by our sponsors. 
						</p> 


							<h3> Mentorship </h3>  
							
							<p> For the first time, we will offer mentorship opportunities to students who would like to get initial feedback on their work by industry colleagues. We aim to increase the chances of innovative student’s work being published, as well as to foster an early exchange across academia and industry. As a mentee, you should expect at least one round of review of your work p
								r to the submission deadline. If your work is accepted, you should  also expect at least one feedback session regarding your demo, poster or oral presentation. </p> 

							<p> If you want to participate in the mentorship program, please <a href="#footer"> get in touch via e-mail. </p> 

						


						<h3>Paper Submission Instructions</h3>

:
							<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation">https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation</a>
							<p>Product size recommendation and fit prediction are critical in order to improve customers’ shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates. However, modeling customers’ fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products and imbalanced label distribution (most of the feedbacks are "Fit"). These datasets, which are the only fit related datasets available publically at this time, collected from ModCloth and RentTheRunWay could be used to address these challenges to improve the recommendation process.</p></li>
